# CARR

This repository contains Java code that I wrote to solve a series of problems that I worked on over a summer internship with a San Diego-based non-profit called CARR. 

The backend package contains classes that are used to clean up the original dataset, extract certain information from it, and then compare certain attributes between the two datasets that I worked on. The Compare class does the majority of the heavy lifting here, and the Record, Statistics, and StringComparator classes are auxiliary classes used to facilitate the algorithms written in Compare.java.

Note that the data that this code operates on is not included in the repository, as it was purchased from the State of California and I don't wish to include it here publically. However, if you're curious about how any of the code works, feel free to contact me and I'd be happy to explain.
