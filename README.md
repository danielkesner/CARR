# CARR

This repository contains Java code that I wrote to solve a series of problems that I worked on over a summer internship with a San Diego-based non-profit called CARR. 

The /backend package contains classes that are used to clean up the original dataset, extract certain information from it, and then compare certain attributes between the two datasets that I worked on. The Compare class does the majority of the heavy lifting here, and the Record, Statistics, and StringComparator classes are auxiliary classes used to facilitate the algorithms written in Compare.java.
